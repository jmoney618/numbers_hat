Number Hat

This app is simple random number generator.
It will to 2 values provided by the user, sort them to make a range and then select a random number within that range.

I created this app because, in my current job, we do a lot of random number picking for a bunch of different things.
Our employees regularly question how "fair" the random selection process is, so I created this app to remove those doubts.
